 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to the Stepdance Software Library documentation. Stepdance is a framework for building
 * motion control systems using modular, composable components.
 *
 * @section overview_sec Overview
 *
 * The Stepdance library provides a flexible architecture for motion control through several key concepts:
 *
 * - **BlockPorts**: Unified interface for connecting components and routing data between them
 * - **Channels**: Position state management and step/direction signal generation
 * - **Input/Output Ports**: Physical hardware interface for receiving and transmitting motion signals
 * - **Generators**: Motion pattern and trajectory generation
 * - **Kinematics**: Coordinate system transformations (Cartesian, polar, CoreXY, etc.)
 * - **Filters**: Signal smoothing and noise reduction
 * - **Interfaces**: External protocol support (G-code, EiBotBoard, etc.)
 *
 * @section getting_started Getting Started
 *
 * To get started with Stepdance:
 * 
 * 1. **Understand BlockPorts**: BlockPorts are the fundamental communication mechanism between
 *    components. See @ref core for details.
 *
 * 2. **Configure Output Ports**: Set up your physical output ports to send step/direction signals.
 *    See @ref io for OutputPort configuration.
 *
 * 3. **Create Channels**: Channels drive motors to target positions. See @ref channels for
 *    Channel setup and usage.
 *
 * 4. **Add Motion Sources**: Connect input ports, generators, or other motion sources to your
 *    channels using BlockPort mapping.
 *
 * @section examples_sec Examples
 *
 * Example code snippets are provided throughout the documentation. Look for code examples in
 * the documentation for each class.
 *
 * @section modules_sec Module Organization
 *
 * The library is organized into functional modules:
 * - @ref core - Core framework components
 * - @ref io - Hardware I/O interfaces
 * - @ref channels - Position control
 * - @ref generators - Motion generation
 * - @ref kinematics - Coordinate transformations
 * - @ref filters - Signal processing
 * - @ref interfaces - External protocols
 * - @ref recording - Motion recording and playback
 * - @ref inputs - Physical input devices
 *
 * @section hardware_sec Supported Hardware
 *
 * Stepdance runs on Teensy microcontrollers and supports:
 * - Basic Modules (single input port)
 * - Machine Controller Modules (multiple I/O ports)
